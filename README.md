# Python Foundations 🐍

This repository documents my journey learning Python fundamentals through CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python (CS50P) by Harvard University,
self-studied via YouTube, along with hands-on practice.

It contains small programs, experiments, and exercises that helped me understand core programming concepts.  
The code is beginner-level by design — this repo is about **learning, consistency, and growth**.

## 📚 What this repository includes

- Python basics (syntax, variables, loops, conditionals)
- Functions and modular code
- Lists, dictionaries, and data handling
- File I/O (reading, writing, CSV, TXT)
- Error handling and exceptions
- Standard libraries (`sys`, `random`, etc.)
- Unit testing with `pytest`
- Small logic-based scripts and exercises

Examples:
- Odd / Even checker  
- Number table generator  
- List & dictionary operations  
- File reading & writing scripts  
- Input validation programs  
- Simple testing examples

## 🧠 Why this repo exists

- To **track my learning progress**
- To build a **strong Python foundation**
- To develop discipline through daily coding
- To prepare for **larger projects and real-world applications**

This is not a polished production repository — it is a **learning log**.

## 🛠️ Tech stack

- Python 3.x
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub
- GitHub Desktop (for version control)

## 🚀 What’s next

- Finish CS50P
- Build beginner projects:
  - Dice rolling game
  - Number guessing game
  - QR code generator
- Move into automation & scripting
- Build larger Python projects (Aim Trainer, advanced scripts)
- Eventually expand into web & systems programming

## 📌 Note

Code quality and structure will improve over time as my skills grow.  
This repository reflects **progress, not perfection**.
